# Fortigate-Offline-Config-Parser

This is a python script that can be used to parse and export the information from a saved Fortigate Firewall config file with the data saved to TSV(Excel) type files which is easier to use in list formats.

This is not a completed or finished script.

This is the location of the original source I used to derive and modify the script from.
